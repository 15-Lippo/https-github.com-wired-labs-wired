You can upload any [VRM](https://vrm.dev/) avatar to use on the Wired.

VRM is a free and open file format for 3D avatars, supported by many applications. You can create a VRM avatar using [VRoid Studio](https://vroid.com/studio/en), or export an avatar to the `.vrm` file format from blender using [this blender plugin](https://github.com/saturday06/VRM_Addon_for_Blender).

Avatars are minted as [Lens Publication NFTs](https://docs.lens.xyz/docs/publication).
