A space is a user-created, 3D multiplayer environment. Spaces are like 3D websites.

## 🏗️ Creation

Spaces are created using the editor - visit the [thewired.space/create](https://www.thewired.space/create) to create a new project and start building. Once your space is ready, you can publish it from the editor as a [Lens Publication NFT](https://docs.lens.xyz/docs/publication). The published scene is stored as a [glTF](https://www.khronos.org/gltf/) model.

The exciting thing about glTF is that its an open file format, supported by many engines. Scenes you create in the editor can be opened in 3D tools like Blender, Unity, and Unreal Engine - or used in other platforms like [Webaverse](https://twitter.com/webaverse).

It also works the other direction - you can import glTF models into the editor and use them in your space.

## ☁️ Hosting

Just like websites, a space needs a server to host it. The team runs a host server that is used by default for spaces created at [thewired.space](https://thewired.space), but you can always change it to a different provider - or even run your own. The host server can be set when publishing your space.

The host server acts like a traditional game server - it manages player connections to your space, handles communication between everyone, and acts as as a source of truth for the state of the space.
