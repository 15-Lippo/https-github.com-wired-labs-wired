# ðŸ’ƒ Avatars

Anyone can upload their own **[VRM](https://vrm.dev/)** avatars to use on The Wired.

VRM is a free and open file format for 3D avatars. If you are new to VRM, there is a **[VRM Blender Addon](https://vrm-addon-for-blender.info/en/)** which can be used to work with VRM avatars in Blender.

Avatars are stored as **[Lens Publication NFTs](https://docs.lens.xyz/docs/publication)**. In the future, this will give you the option to monetize your avatars.
