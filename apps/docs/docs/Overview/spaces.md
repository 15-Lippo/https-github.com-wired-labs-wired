At its core, The Wired is built around the idea of a space. **A space is a user-created, 3d multiplayer environment**. Spaces are like 3d websites - anyone can create one, you can join them through a link, and they require a server to host them.

Spaces are stored as **[Lens Publication NFTs](https://docs.lens.xyz/docs/publication)**.

## Creation

Spaces are created using the studio - a visual editor similar to Unity. The studio can be found at **[thewired.space/studio](https://www.thewired.space/studio)**, or you can download the code from **[GitHub](https://github.com/wired-xr/wired)** and run it locally.

## Hosting

Spaces require a server to host them. The host server acts like a traditional game server - it manages player connections to your space, handles communication between everyone, etc. The team runs a free host server at **host.thewired.space**, but you can always run your own.

The host server you want to use can be set on your profile. Any spaces you own will use your specified host server.
