# ðŸŒ¿ Identity

The Wired is built on tope of **[Lens](https://lens.xyz/)**, a decentralized social graph protocol. With Lens, you can mint a **[Profile NFT](https://docs.lens.xyz/docs/profile)** - and this profile is used to identify you on The Wired. It works like a traditional social media profile - you can set a profile picture, bio, and whatever other information you want.

## Why Lens?

The exciting thing about Lens is that it's **decentralized**. Your profile data isn't stored on some company's servers - its stored on Ethereum. **This means you can use the same identity across different apps**. For example, you could friend somebody on The Wired, then open a third party chat app and message your new friend without having to exchange information.

It also means you can no longer get deleted from a platform and lose access to your data. **Centralized services can (and will) still ban people**, but this only prevents them from showing up through that specific service - your profile data will still exist on Ethereum.

## Publications

Content you create on The Wired is stored as a Lens Publication NFT. This gives creators a way to **monetize** their work - whether it be by selling avatars, or selling VIP passes to their space. It also opens the door for new, expiremental methods of monetization to be created in the future.

Publications have the same benefits of decentralization that profiles have. You have full ownership of your data.

## Data Storage

While ownership of data is handled using Lens, most of the actual data itself is stored over **[IPFS](https://ipfs.io/)**. This is a decentralized, peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data. For example, if you create an avatar on The Wired you mint an avatar Publication NFT, but the avatar file itself is stored over IPFS.
