To log in to The Wired, you need a **wallet**. A wallet is a piece of software that manages a private key, and is used for authentication. You can use any wallet that supports **[Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/)**.

## Why use a wallet to log in?

Typically, you store your login information with a third party, like Apple. You then log in to their servers and ask them to authenticate you. They have full control, and can block you from logging in. There is also the security risk of them getting hacked, and your information leaking onto the internet.

With a wallet, **you can cryptographically verify your identity without relying on a third party**. Anyone who has access to your private key has access to your account. It's like a password, keep it safe!

A wallet is also needed to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. It can be used to send transactions, and stores information about your account.

## Which wallet should I get?

- For pc only, we recommend **[Metamask](https://metamask.io/)**, a browser extension.
- For any other platform, we recommend **[Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/)**, an app on your phone.
