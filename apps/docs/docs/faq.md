It's important to understand what a wallet is and how it works. We recommend reading **[this article](https://learn.rainbow.me/crypto-and-wallets)** to learn more. To put it briefly, a wallet is used to cryptographically verify your identity without any third parties. You can think of it as a replacement for a username and password - so keep it safe! **Only connect your wallet to sites you trust.**
