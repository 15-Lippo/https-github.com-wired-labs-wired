The Wired is a web-based virtual worlds platform **done right**.

Built on top of open standards and decentralized infrastructure, the Wired reimagines the web as an interconnected network of 3D spaces, instead of 2D pages. You can access the Wired through any browser, on any device.

The team hosts [thewired.space](https://thewired.space), but all code is open source and free to use
on our [GitHub](https://github.com/wired-xr/wired).
